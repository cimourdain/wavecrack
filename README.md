Outline
-------
* This Web application can be used to launch **asynchronous password cracks with hashcat**.  
* The interface tries to be as **user-friendly** as possible and facilitates the password cracking method choice and to **automate the succession of various attack modes**.  
* It also displays **statistics regarding the cracked passwords** and allows to **export the cracked password list in CSV**.  
* The application is designed to be used in a multi-user environment with a **strict segregation between the cracking results of different users**: the user authentication can be done through an **LDAP directory or basic auth**.  
  
  
Usage
-----
Wavecrack can be used to do the following:
* Add new password hashes, choose the **attack mode and the crack duration**
* View the **past and current cracks** for your user with **statistics and graphs**
* View the **overall load** of the platform
* Upload a **password-protected file** and extract its hash

The **attack modes** are followed in the order they are displayed on the hash submit form.  
It is also possible to stop a crack. However, **every cancelation is final.**  
A limit to the amount of **concurrent cracks** can be defined in the settings in order not to reduce the current cracks performance.  
  
  
Requirements
------------
* python 2.7 (not compatible with python 3)
* [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/): follow [these instructions](https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=3432#c6062) for CPU only usage on a Kali linux host 
* flask (>=0.10.1)
* celery (>=3.1.18)
* SQLite (>=3.8.7.4)
* rabbitmq-server (>= 3.4.3)
* Rules for hashcat ([examples](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack))
* Wordlists ([examples](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-1236.html))

Installation
------------
* Install the RabbitMQ server and `python-ldap` requirements
```
$ apt-get install libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev rabbitmq-server
```

```
$ yaourt -S libsm libsasl2 rabbitmq
```

  
* Install the python [requirements](requirements.txt)
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
* Create a `cracker/app_settings.py` configuration file from the [`cracker/app_settings.py.example`](cracker/app_settings.py.example) file and notably edit the `Mandatory settings` section:
    * The path of hashcat
    * The RabbitMQ connection string: by default, the guest/guest account is used. Be sure to harden your installation
    * The path of the SQLite database
    * The path of the hashcat rules
    * The path of the wordlists 
    * The LDAP parameters:
        * IP address
        * port
        * LDAP database for the users
        * Base DN
  
* Initialize the local database linked in the `cracker/app_settings.py` configuration file
```
$ sqlite3 base.db < setup_resources/base_schema.sql
```
  
* Start the RabbitMQ server
```
# service rabbitmq-server start
```
or
```
# systemctl enable rabbitmq 
# systemctl start rabbitmq
```
  
* Start Celery from the application folder
```
$ celery worker -A cracker.celery
```
  
* Launch the Flask Web server
    * Directly from the `server.py` file: this mode is not suitable for production purpose
    ```
    $ python server.py
    ```
    * With a [`wsgi script`](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/): an example of [`app.wsgi.example`](setup_resources/app.wsgi.example) is provided
    * Similarly, [`supervisorctl`](http://supervisord.org/) can be used to manage celery with a configuration file example in [`supervisorcelery.conf.example`](setup_resources/supervisorcelery.conf.example)  
  
* In order to stop the cracks after a certain amount of time, you can use the [`provided cron script`](setup_resources/cronscript.py).
  
* If you want to update the list of hashes supported, you can use the [`dedicated script`](setup_resources/extract_hashcat_examples.py) which will parse [hashcat's wiki](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) and generate an updated [hashcat_hashes.py](cracker/hashcat_hashes.py). To do so, you need to have BeautifulSoup installed on your system.

Finally, if you don't want to setup your own VM, you can use the Docker-based process described in the [`docker`](Docker/) folder.
